# __autoclicker and anti afk__
##### Antivirus may trigger because there is a compiled python as an unsigned .exe

##### How to use
1. pip install requirements.txt
2. Launch autoclicker.py/exe or launch Anti-AFK.py

##### Add autoclicker (255) to an hotkey
1. Right-click the desktop shortcut and select Properties from the menu
2. Click the Shortcut tab
3. Click the Shortcut key box and enter a new keyboard shortcut for the program or web page. Just enter a letter there to set up the new hotkey. Note that the shortcut will be the letter combined with Ctrl + Alt. So if you type “I,” then the keyboard shortcut would be Ctrl + Alt + I. You can also enter one of the function keys (F1 through F12 on most keyboards)
4. Select Apply and then click OK to close the window
5. Press your new hotkey to test it out, and it should open the program or web page you specified
